# Alcatraz

Everyone of us, atleast once in our lifetime, would have used (or) come across Live Train Running Status Applications in both Mobile Devices while travelling from one place to other, so that either we could have a sound sleep or do any scheduled tasks while our Phone reminds us of our destination well early in time so that we could prepare ourselves to get down in our destination, especially when the stopping time in that destination is going to be less.

However, there might be sensitive times where there might be Privileged People [like Foreign Delegates, Chief-Office Bearers of the Country/State, etc...] who might wish to travel via Indian Railways; in such a scenario it is of utmost priority that the trains they are travelling must be not allowed for the Public to Live-Track as that can put their lives at significant risk.
	
So, to combat it in a comprehensive way, this Project aims to Simulate a HTTPS Based Access Privileges Control System that only allows the admin [The Members of the Main Control Room] to view the Live Status of the Train in which the VIP is travelling while the Common Public is denied the access to view them. This is achieved by using Simple HTML, CSS and Django-based Client-Server Communication.

Why the name 'Alcatraz'? The name was inspired from the imfamous Alcatraz Jail Break Incident where three Prisoners allegedly escaped the seemingly called "The Most heavily guarded and impossible to break" prison on one fine day in June 1962, meaning that even though we might feel that our data and devices are very safe and secure, there are people out there trying out infinite possible ways to identify loopholes in the system and gain illegal access. So, I happily present to you, "Alcatraz".
